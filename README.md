# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Show real-time buses moving between MIT and Harvard 
Added a night theme to the map as well as creating custom bus icons.

## How to run
1. Go to the Google Maps Platform and enable Maps Javascript API in a new Google Cloud Project
2. You will need to add billing information but you wont be charged unless you go over usage amount which you wont for this.
3. Then you will need to create your own API key.
4. Paste your API key in html file where it says your API key.
5. Load the index.html file into a browers

## Road map for future improvements
I would like to give more information on the icons for say ride capacity and next stop available
